# Week-7
Week 7 Starter Files

In this week, we are going to review what we learned about vanilla Python with a few questions. We are going to discuss around these questions. And please submit your completed notebook by next class (10/29).
  - Note that the last question is optional; although you are __not__ required to complete it for submission, I strongly suggest you spend some time trying to solve the problem - since it will test you comprehensively on what we have covered in this course so far.
